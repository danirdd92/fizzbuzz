I've heard they give this interview question called fizz-buzz:
* Print numbers from 1-100
* Change all numbers divisible by 3 with "fizz"
* Change numbers divisble by 5 with "buzz"
* Change numbers divisible by both with "fizzbuzz"

So I decided to solve this question in a more functional paradigm using C# newer features.
